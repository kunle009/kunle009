<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kunle</h1>
<h2 align="center"> A Graduate Structural Engineer and Software Developer Enthusiast</h2>

 As a recent civil engineering graduate, I currently work as a graduate structural engineer, specializing in steel and concrete design for high-rise and industrial structures. My passion lies at the intersection of structural engineering and software development. Iâ€™ve always been a computer hobbyist, and I thrive on creating digital solutions to engineering challenges.
