<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kunle</h1>
<h2 align="center"> A Graduate Structural Engineer and Software Developer Enthusiast</h2>
 I'm a recent graduate of civil engineering and I currently work as a graduate structural engineer where I focus on steel and concrete 
 design of high rise and industrial structures. I have always been a computer hobbyist and I am very comfortable working in the intersection between the two challenging fields of structural engineering and software development. I love providing digital solutions to my engineering problems.
