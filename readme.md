<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Kunle</h1>
<h2 align="center"> A Graduate Structural Engineer and Software Developer Enthusiast</h2>
 I'm a recent graduate of civil engineering and I currently work as a graduate structural engineer where I focus on steel and concrete 
 design of high rise and industrial structures. I have always been a computer hobbyist and I am very comfortable working in the intersection between the two challenging fields of structural engineering and software development. I love providing digital solutions to engineering problems.

## 💻 Ongoing Projects
<p>
        Some of my recent ongoing projects include:
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a website to analyse and design combined pile caps</li>
          <li>Building the web app of my python package called FoundationDesign</li>
          <li>Writing code solutions for custom analysis and design of various structural elements</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

## 📋 Current Interests

I am a life long learner and I find it interesting doing research and solving problems, my interests includes:

- Learning how to use FastApi to build robust structural engineering api's
- Training LLM's on industry domain api's in other to improve their understanding of structural design.
- Using new platforms like Speckle to create custom saas based engineering solutions
- Learning about computational design using grasshopper for structural engineering practice
- Learning how to use common industry api's including TeklaOpenApi, Revit, CSI api and others.

## 🎯 Exploring Collaborative Opportunities

I am currently exploring opportunities for remote work, specifically in software development internships, within construction technology startups in the AEC industry. My aim is to contribute to exciting projects, learn, and grow in a dynamic environment. If you have a fitting opportunity, let's connect and explore possibilities together!
