<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kunle</h1>
<h2 align="center"> A Graduate Structural Engineer and Software Developer Enthusiast</h2>
 I'm a recent graduate of civil engineering and I currently work as a graduate structural engineer where I focus on steel and concrete 
 design of high rise and industrial structures. I have always been a computer hobbyist and I am very comfortable working in the intersection between the two challenging fields of structural engineering and software development. I love providing digital solutions to my engineering problems.

## Current Projects
<p>
        Some of my recent projects include:
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a website to analyse and design combined pile caps</li>
          <li>Building the web app of my python package called FoundationDesign</li>
          <li>Writing code solutions for custom analysis and design of various structural elements</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

## ðŸŒ± Current Interests

I am a life long learner and I find it interesting doing research and solving problems

- Learning how to use FastApi to build robust structural engineering api's
- Training LLM's on industry domain api's in other to improve their understanding of structural design.
- Using new platforms like Speckle to create custom saas based engineering solutions
- Learning about computational design using grasshopper for structural engineering practice
- Learning how to use common industry api's including TeklaOpenApi, Revit, CSI api and others.
