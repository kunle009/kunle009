<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kunle</h1>
<h2 align="center"> A Graduate Structural Engineer and Software Developer Enthusiast</h2>

 Hello! I'm a civil engineering graduate, currently working as a structural engineer with a specialization in steel and concrete design for high-rise and industrial structures. Beyond my engineering role, I'm deeply passionate about the fusion of structural engineering and software development currently focused on backend development. As a computer hobbyist, I find joy in crafting digital solutions to tackle engineering challenges. Join me on this journey at the intersection of innovation and construction!
